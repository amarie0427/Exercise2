# CIT 127 - Exercise 02: Programming with Github

**Version:** 11/21/2019

## Student Info

Replace this line with your Name, CRN, and Semester Year here using unordered bullets in Markdown.

## Directions

In this exercise, you will be exploring using Git with the Print and Input methods. Create a simple Python program following the instructions below. Each step **MUST** have its own commit in Github.

1. Update the Markdown file README.md with your Name, CRN, and Semester / Year in bullet format under the Student Info section (required for all assignments in Github).
2. Update the Python file to include your Name, CRN, and Semester / Year in the indicated comments (required for all assignments in Github)
3. Take input using the input() method and save it to the variable myInput
4. Output message "Hello" with your Name. Example: "Hello, Brenda"
5. Output a 15 word or more sentence explaining what **challenges** you expect when using Git in software development.

## Rubric / Grading Scale

Each step is worth 4 points with 5 steps to be completed for a total of 20 points.

* Each step has its own commit in Github made by the student. (2pt)
* Instructions are followed for each step. (2pt)

### Additional Grading Notes

* Programmers must have attention to detail, as a result up to __2 Points__ may be taken for not updating the student info (Name, CRN, Semester Year) in the __Markdown__ and __Python Comments__.
* Customers will not pay for programs that do not work, as a result up to __20 Points__ may be taken for programs that do not run due to syntax errors.
* Programmers tend to forget how large programs work over time, as a result up to __4 Points__ may be taken for programs that do not have a _reasonable_ amount of comments that describe key sections of code.
* Minimum of 4 or more commits made to GitHub showing incremental programming changes towards the final program (4pt)
  * 1 Commit may be for updating Student Info in the Markdown and Python File
  * 3 Commits must be for programming updates to source code
  * If a unit test is available, no changes made to the Unit Test will count towards the required commits (nor should there be any changes made to this file).
* All programs must have your Github URL submitted in Canvas via the assignment page. Unsubmitted Github repos will receive __0 Points__.
* Programs that have been submitted and received a grade will not be regraded, unless the instructor makes a request for changes.
* If a program is eligible for regrading, it is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor when the program is ready for regrading.
* Professional programmers are required to hit tough deadlines, late Assignments will loose __2 Points__.
